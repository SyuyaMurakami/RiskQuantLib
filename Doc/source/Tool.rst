RiskQuantLib provides different kinds of tools to do different work, like ``stringTool``, ``fileTool``, ``databaseTool``, etc. All these tools can be changed to suit your style of coding. You can refer to `Details <https://riskquantlib-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/RiskQuantLib.Tool.html>`_ for more information.

**Notice: RiskQuantLib is not designed to provide with detail functions, such as connecting to database or dealing with string. It is designed as an scaffold, like a box where you put all your familiar tools into it. RiskQuantLib will package those tools into a module, and make it convient to use next time. So here, all these kinds of tools are more examples than tools, it help users to understand how RiskQuantLib organize a project.**
