To install RiskQuantLib, you can use ``pip`` command in terminal as follows:
::

   pip install RiskQuantLib --upgrade

RiskQuantLib can also be downloaded in Github: `RiskQuantLib <https://github.com/SyuyaMurakami/RiskQuantLib>`_

After installing RiskQuantLib, it is recommended to initialize default module by:
::

    initRQL

It is also OK if you do not run this terminal command. It is just used to remove some module that is not frequently used from default modules.
